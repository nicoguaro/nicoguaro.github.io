During October (2017) I wrote a program per day for some well-known numerical
methods in both Python and Julia. It was intended to be an exercise, then don't
expect the code to be good enough for real use. Also, I should mention that I
had almost no experience with Julia, so it probably is not idiomatic Julia but
more Python-like Julia.

This post is a summary of that challenge.
