.. type: text
.. status: draft

This is the first post about technical writing [*]_ from a series that
I will be creating during the course of this year.

Future posts will (probably) be about:

- Using equations;

- Using figures;

- Using tables; and

- Managing bibliographic references.

The current post
================

According to the `U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <https://www.bls.gov/ooh/media-and-communication/technical-writers.htm>`_

  Technical writers prepare instruction manuals, how-to guides,
  journal articles, and other supporting documents to communicate complex and
  technical information more easily.

And it is a desired skill in the workplace. Its demand is expected to grow
around 10% in the current decade.

According Butterick's "Typography in ten minutes":

1. The most important typographic selection is on the body text.
   This is due to the fact that it is most of the document.

2. Choose a point size between 10-12 points for printed documents
   and 15-25 pixels for digital documents.

3. Line spacing should be between 120-145 % of the point size.

4. Line length should be between 45-90 characters. This is roughly
   2 or 3 small caps alphabets:

   abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcd

5. Mind the selection of your font. Try to avoid default fonts such as
   Arial, Calibri or Times New Roman.

   research tools that most of us need but are not commonly taught in a formal
   fashion.
